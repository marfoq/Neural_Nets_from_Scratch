# Neural Nets from Scratch


In this project, we propose an implementation of shallow dense neural networks from scratch. The project will contain four parts:
 1) Generating an artificial dataset to train and test the our neural networks
 2) Implement **NeuralNet** class which is the main class of our project, this class should have two functions **forward_propagate** and **backwar-propagate**
 3) Create two finction **train** and **test**, to train and evaluate a neuralnetwork
 4) Finally, we propose to create a notebook where we will analyse our model and his performence when used with different dataset, and the influence of the choice of hyperparametrs on the model, we will also compare our implementation to pre-existing implementations (Keras, torch..)
